# xkcd

Download xkcd comics using python3

#### Modules used:
  1. ```os```
  2. ```requests```
  3. ```BeautifulSoup```

**Note:** works only on python3 since ```os.makedirs('xkcd', exist_ok = True)``` is used

#### to-do:
  * ~~use threading to speed up things~~
  * create a ```setup.py``` to install required modules
  * ~~change the func such that it finds the latest image number~~
  * change the func such that it autoamtically downloads the latest instead of manually having to do so.
