#### Modules used:
  1. ```os```
  2. ```threading```
  3. ```re```
  4. ```requests```
  5. ```BeautifulSoup```

**Note:** works only on python3 since ```os.makedirs('xkcd', exist_ok = True)``` is used

#### to-do:
  * ~~use threading to speed up things~~
  * ~~create a ```setup.py``` to install required modules~~
  * ~~change the func such that it finds the latest image number~~
  * change the func such that it autoamtically downloads the latest instead of manually having to do so.
